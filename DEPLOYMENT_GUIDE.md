## What You Need

1. **A Hosting Account** (Shared hosting or better)
2. **Domain Name** (optional, but recommended)
3. **File Manager Access** (included with your hosting account)

## Files to Upload

Upload **ALL** files from the `dist` folder to your hosting account:

```jsx

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.svg
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-8tcZEzWU.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-C9lDzDRW.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.es-DxvynqtM.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ html2canvas.esm-BfxBtG_O.js
    â””â”€â”€ purify.es-CQJ0hv7W.js
```

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Access Your Hosting File Manager

1. Log into your hosting control panel
2. Find and click on "File Manager" or "cPanel File Manager"
3. Navigate to your website's root directory (usually `public_html`)

### Step 2: Upload Files

1. **Option A - Drag & Drop:**
   - Select all files from your `dist` folder
   - Drag them directly into the File Manager
   - Upload to the root directory

2. **Option B - Upload Button:**
   - Click "Upload" in File Manager
   - Select all files from your `dist` folder
   - Upload to the root directory

### Step 3: Verify Upload

Your file structure should look like this:

```jsx
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.svg
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-8tcZEzWU.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-C9lDzDRW.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.es-DxvynqtM.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ html2canvas.esm-BfxBtG_O.js
    â””â”€â”€ purify.es-CQJ0hv7W.js
```

### Step 4: Test Your App

1. Visit your domain: `https://yourdomain.com`
2. The Contractor Tracker App should load immediately
3. Test all features: adding hours, creating invoices, etc.

## Important Notes

### What Works

- **All features** work exactly as in development
- **Data persistence** using browser localStorage
- **PDF generation** for invoices and reports
- **Email functionality** (opens default email client)
- **Export/Import** data backup features

### Limitations

- **No server-side storage** - data is stored in browser
- **No user accounts** - anyone with access can use the app
- **No real-time sync** - data is local to each device

### Security Considerations

- **Password protection** - set up app password for basic security
- **Regular backups** - use the export feature regularly
- **Private hosting** - consider who has access to your hosting

## Domain Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Domain

1. In your hosting account, go to "Domains" â†’ "Manage"
2. Point your domain to your hosting
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Subdomain (Recommended)

Create a subdomain like `hours.yourdomain.com`:

1. Go to "Domains" â†’ "Manage" â†’ "DNS"
2. Add a CNAME record: `hours` â†’ `yourdomain.com`
3. Upload files to `public_html/hours/` folder
