# 🚀 Hours Tracker - GoDaddy Deployment Guide

## 📋 What You Need

1. **GoDaddy Hosting Account** (Shared hosting or better)
2. **Domain Name** (optional, but recommended)
3. **File Manager Access** (included with GoDaddy hosting)

## 📁 Files to Upload

Upload **ALL** files from the `dist` folder to your GoDaddy hosting:

```
dist/
├── index.html
├── vite.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-8tcZEzWU.js
    ├── index-C9lDzDRW.css
    ├── index.es-DxvynqtM.js
    ├── html2canvas.esm-BfxBtG_O.js
    └── purify.es-CQJ0hv7W.js
```

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Access GoDaddy File Manager
1. Log into your GoDaddy hosting control panel
2. Find and click on "File Manager" or "cPanel File Manager"
3. Navigate to your website's root directory (usually `public_html`)

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. **Option A - Drag & Drop:**
   - Select all files from your `dist` folder
   - Drag them directly into the File Manager
   - Upload to the root directory

2. **Option B - Upload Button:**
   - Click "Upload" in File Manager
   - Select all files from your `dist` folder
   - Upload to the root directory

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Your file structure should look like this:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── vite.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-8tcZEzWU.js
    ├── index-C9lDzDRW.css
    ├── index.es-DxvynqtM.js
    ├── html2canvas.esm-BfxBtG_O.js
    └── purify.es-CQJ0hv7W.js
```

### Step 4: Test Your App
1. Visit your domain: `https://yourdomain.com`
2. The Hours Tracker should load immediately
3. Test all features: adding hours, creating invoices, etc.

## 🔧 Important Notes

### ✅ What Works
- **All features** work exactly as in development
- **Data persistence** using browser localStorage
- **PDF generation** for invoices and reports
- **Email functionality** (opens default email client)
- **Export/Import** data backup features

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **No server-side storage** - data is stored in browser

- **No real-time sync** - data is local to each device

### 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Password protection** - set up app password for basic security
- **Regular backups** - use the export feature regularly
- **Private hosting** - consider who has access to your hosting

## 🌐 Domain Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Domain
1. In GoDaddy, go to "Domains" → "Manage"
2. Point your domain to your hosting
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Subdomain (Recommended)
Create a subdomain like `hours.yourdomain.com`:
1. Go to "Domains" → "Manage" → "DNS"
2. Add a CNAME record: `hours` → `yourdomain.com`
3. Upload files to `public_html/hours/` folder
